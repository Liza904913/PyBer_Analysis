# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview:

The purpose of analysis is to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine prices for different city types.

## Resources:
Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
Software: Python 3.7.7, Anaconda Navigator 1.9.12, Conda 4.8.4, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3

## Results:

## Summary:

In the most underserved neighborhoods, PyBer ride-sharing services would not be the first option for travels as the fares are pretty high.
The correlation between the drivers force, the number of rides and the average fare price is not clear so additional analysis including geographic size, travel distances, cellphone coverage would be needed to get a clearer picture.
Suburban drivers were only about 17% of the total drivers but accounted for more than 30% of the total fares and just above a quarter of the rides.
Improving access to PyBer service in those areas will imply finding the right balance between incentives for more riders to join in and the right fare charge that will motivates riders to pick PyBer app as the first choice for their travels.
Additional analysis including geographic size, population and social conditions, travel distances would be interesting to dive in.
The general tendencies is high number of drivers and rides goes with medium to low fare.
On the scatter plot, we notice some urban cities with low number of drivers and low average fare but pretty high count of rides. Analyzing the average number of drivers against the population and infrastructure and economic activity in those cities would help understand those disparities.
